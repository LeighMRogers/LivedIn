Their website for payments is confusing so it's a huge chance they will charge you extra the first month there. Also if you want to break the lease early they charge a full extra month and also at least 300 dollars extra for ... for cleaning!? Even though the place was left spotless! Their gym is a joke, their pool is mostly dirty and also the swimming season for them it's probably for 2 months or less! Customer service sucks too, they never tell anything, you always have to insist for information. Anyways... don't necessarily take my word for it ... Go there and see for yourself or do yourself a favor and avoid this place!",
